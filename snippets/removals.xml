    PROJECT REMOVALS
    ================================================================
    Use this to remove a project that was included in another manifest.
    This is useful for replacing a stock AOSP app with your own version.
    ================================================================
  -->

  <!-- Example: Remove the stock AOSP Settings app -->
  <remove-project name="platform/packages/apps/Settings" />

  <!--
    Then, you would add your own forked Settings app project.
    For example, in core.xml or device.xml you could add:
    <project path="packages/apps/MySettings" name="android_packages_apps_MySettings" remote="myos" />
  -->
